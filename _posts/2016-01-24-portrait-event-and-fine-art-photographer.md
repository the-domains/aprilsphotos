**_[Welcome to the new site of AprilsPhotos!][0]_**

## Portrait, Event and Fine Art photographer. 

It's still in beta so don't judge too harshly. Most of my content can be found on the facebook business page. [www.facebook.com/aprilspix ][1]

Photography has always been an interest of mine, and with a dad who retired from Kodak, it seems fitting that I became a photographer. People ask me all the time, what I shoot. My response is still the same "do I have to choose?" From flowers to people to weddings - I love it all.

## Portraits:

## Events:

* School Dances
* Birthday Party
* Weddings and Vow Renewals
* Anniversary Party

## Fine Art:
